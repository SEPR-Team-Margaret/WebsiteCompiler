						<h3>A new logo</h3>
						Our team now has a logo! Ollie created a new svg logo to be used on our website that we think represents our game development team very well.

				<h3>Assessment 1 Complete</h3>
				Assessment 1 is finally complete! All documents and additional related documents can be found under assessment 1 with the assessments dropdown. Resources including architecture, method selection & planning, requirements and risk assessment & mitigation can be found here. In the extras section, we have also included gantt charts, found in method selection & planning, that sets out our workload for upcoming assessments in chronological order. The use case document outlines how our game will play, summarising how a player's turn will pan out. There is also an image of the paper prototype that was created and shown to our customer to get feedback on how we planned our game to work, all of which has been worked into the relevant documents.
